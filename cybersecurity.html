I spent my senior year at my alma mater, Hampshire College, doing research on the emerging market of automotive cybersecurity. The development and deployment of connected and automated vehicles create a need for this kind of technology. Would one really want an automated vehicle to take the wheel without having any protection against potential cyber-attacks? I am focused on addressing one of the biggest concerns of the automated vehicle market - the lack of protection from hackers. Links to download my thesis are found below.
