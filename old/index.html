<p>
I was born in China and moved to the US when I was 16 years old to attend a prestigious private boarding school in New England.
I graduated from Hampshire College in the spring of 2017 with a study focus in Entrepreneurship and Computer Science. I spent a year researching autonomous vehice cybersecurity, concluding in a thesis paper and symposium presentation. I travel frequently between North Carolina's Research Triangle Area and the Bay Area.
