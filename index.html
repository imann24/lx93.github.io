<p>
I was born in China and moved to the US when I was 16 years old and attended a prestigious private boarding school in New England.
My entreprneurial pursuit is focused on addressing one of the biggest concerns of highly automated vehicles - the lack of protection from malicious hackers. I recently graduated from Hampshire College after spending a whole year researching on this very issue.
I travel frequently between Raleigh-Durham area and Sillicon Valley.</p>
