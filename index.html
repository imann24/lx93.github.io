<p>
I was born in China and moved to the US when I was 16 years old to attend a prestigious private boarding school in New England.
I graduated from Hampshire College in the spring of 2017 with a major in Entrepreneurship and Technology. I spent a year researching autonomous vehice cyber-security, concluding in a thesis paper and symposium presentation.
I travel frequently between North Carolina's Research Triangle area and Silicon Valley.</p>
